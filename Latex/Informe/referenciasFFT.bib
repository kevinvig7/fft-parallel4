However, radix-2k was only proposed for Single-path Delay Feedback (SDF) architectures, but not for feedforward ones, also called Multi-path Delay Commutator (MDC).},

	abstract = {This paper presents a systematicfolding transformation technique to fold any arbitrary signal processing algorithm data-flow graph to a hardware data-flow architecture, for a specified folding set and specified technology constraints. The folding set specifies the processor in which and the time partition at which the task is executed. The folding set is typically obtained by performing scheduling and resource allocation for the algorithm data-flow graph and the specified iteration period. The technology constraints imposed on the hardware architecture (i.e., the level of pipelining and the implementation style of each processor) are also assumed to be known. The folding technique is used to derive the control circuitry of the hardware architecture (including registers, switches, and interconnections). We derive conditions for the validity of a specified folding set, and present approaches to generate the dedicated architecture using systematic folding of tasks to operators. We propose automatic retiming and pipelining of algorithms described by data-flow graphsforfolding. The folding algorithm is applied after preprocessing the data-flow graph (DFG) for automated pipelining and retiming. Our folding algorithm can accommodate single or multiple implementation styles and single or multiple computation clocks, and applies to folding of regular and irregular data-flow graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to develop parallel pipelined architectures for the fast Fourier transform (FFT). A formal procedure for designing FFT architectures using folding transformation and register minimization techniques is proposed. Novel parallel-pipelined architectures for the computation of complex and real valued fast Fourier transform are derived. For complex valued Fourier transform (CFFT), the proposed architecture takes advantage of under utilized hardware in the serial architecture to derive -parallel architectures without increasing the hardware complexity by a factor of . The operating frequency of the proposed architecture can be decreased which in turn reduces the power consumption. Further, this paper presents new parallel-pipelined architectures for the computation of real-valued fast Fourier transform (RFFT). The proposed architectures exploit redundancy in the computation of FFT samples to reduce the hardware complexity. A comparison is drawn between the proposed designs and the previous architectures. The power consumption can be reduced up to 37\% and 50\% in 2-parallel CFFT and RFFT architectures, respectively. The output samples are obtained in a scrambled order in the proposed architectures. Circuits to reorder these scrambled output sequences to a desired order are presented.},
