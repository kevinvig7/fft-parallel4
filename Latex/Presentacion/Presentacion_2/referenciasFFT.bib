Radix-2 and radix-2k feedforward architectures based on rotator allocation are presented in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed architectures reduce the hardware cost signiﬁcantly with respect to previous {FFT} architectures.},

A formal procedure for designing FFT architectures using folding transformation and register minimization techniques is proposed. Novel parallel-pipelined architectures for the computation of complex and real valued fast Fourier transform are derived. For complex valued Fourier transform (CFFT), the proposed architecture takes advantage of under utilized hardware in the serial architecture to derive -parallel architectures without increasing the hardware complexity by a factor of . The operating frequency of the proposed architecture can be decreased which in turn reduces the power consumption. Further, this paper presents new parallel-pipelined architectures for the computation of real-valued fast Fourier transform (RFFT). The proposed architectures exploit redundancy in the computation of FFT samples to reduce the hardware complexity. A comparison is drawn between the proposed designs and the previous architectures. The power consumption can be reduced up to 37\% and 50\% in 2-parallel CFFT and RFFT architectures, respectively. The output samples are obtained in a scrambled order in the proposed architectures. Circuits to reorder these scrambled output sequences to a desired order are presented.},

This approach calculates the direction of the micro-rotations from the control counter of the {FFT}, so the area of the rotator hardly depends on the number of rotations, which is particularly suitable for the computation of {FFTs} of a high number of points. Moreover, the new {CORDIC} presents other advantages such as the simpliﬁcation of the basic {CORDIC} processor used to calculate the micro-rotations, or an easy way to compensate the intrinsic gain of the {CORDIC} algorithm. Additionally, the {VLSI} implementation of the algorithm is a pipeline architecture with high performance in terms of speed, throughput and latency.},

	abstract = {High-radix Cooley-Turkey {FFT} algorithms have obvious advantages: less multiplications and reduced memory accesses so power consumption can be reduced. However, the disadvantages are that traditional direct mapping implementation of high-radix butterfly element will required more complex multipliers and thus large silicon area will be consumed. In this paper, we proposed an eficient approach to realize the high radix butterflyprocess element. This approach employed pipelining technics to cascade the paralleled multipliers and thusfewer complex multipliers are utilized to realize the radix-r butterfy element. This approach can achieve a good trade-off between speed and area in the design of high radix butterfly element.},

Based on the radix-16 {FFT} algorithm, the proposed {FFT} architecture utilizes cascaded simplified radix-24 single-path delay feedback ({SDF}) structures. The control circuit of the proposed simplified radix-24 {SDF} {FFT} architecture is simple. The hardware requirement of the proposed {FFT} architecture only needs 1 complex multiplier and 56 complex adders for supporting 256-point computations. The computation complexity of multiplications and the hardware complexity of the proposed {FFT} architecture need less complexity than both complexities of the previous {FFT} structures in 256-point {FFT} applications. In hardware verifications, the output throughput rate of our {FFT} design processes up to 35.5M samples/sec with Xilinx Virtex2 1500 {FPGA}, and it processes up to 51.5M samples/sec with {UIMC} 0.18gm standard cell technology.

The folding set specifies the processor in which and the time partition at which the task is executed. The folding set is typically obtained by performing scheduling and resource allocation for the algorithm data-flow graph and the specified iteration period. The technology constraints imposed on the hardware architecture (i.e., the level of pipelining and the implementation style of each processor) are also assumed to be known. The folding technique is used to derive the control circuitry of the hardware architecture (including registers, switches, and interconnections). We derive conditions for the validity of a specified folding set, and present approaches to generate the dedicated architecture using systematic folding of tasks to operators. We propose automatic retiming and pipelining of algorithms described by data-flow graphsforfolding. The folding algorithm is applied after preprocessing the data-flow graph (DFG) for automated pipelining and retiming. Our folding algorithm can accommodate single or multiple implementation styles and single or multiple computation clocks, and applies to folding of regular and irregular data-flow graphs.},
