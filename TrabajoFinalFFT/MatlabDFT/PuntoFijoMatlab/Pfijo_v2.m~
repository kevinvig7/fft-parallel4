% Fixed-point data types can be either signed or unsigned. Signed binary fixed-point numbers are 
% typically represented in one of three ways:
% Sign/magnitude
% One's complement
% Two's complement
% Two's complement is the most common representation of signed fixed-point numbers and is 
% the only representation used by Fixed-Point Designerâ„¢ documentation.

% Create a fixed-point vector.
a = fi([1,2,5,7],0,4,0)
disp(bin(a))

% Concatenate the bits of the elements of a.
y = bitconcat(a)
disp(bin(y))
