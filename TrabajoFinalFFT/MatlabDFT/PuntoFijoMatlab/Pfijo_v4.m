% Casting with the reinterpretcast Function
% B is an unsigned fi object with a word length of 8 bits and a fraction length of 5 bits. The

%% The fimath Object
% fimath properties define the rules for performing arithmetic operations on fi objects, including math, rounding, and overflow properties.

% You can attach a fimath object to a fi object by using setfimath

%% Bit Growth
% The word length of acc increases with each iteration of the loop. 
% This increase causes two problems: One is that code generation does not allow changing data types in a loop. 
% The other is that, if the loop is long enough, you run out of memory in MATLAB

% Subscripted Assignment
% Another way to control bit growth is by using subscripted assignment. a(I) = b
% Evita que la variable 'acc' crezac en número de bits
T.acc = fi([],1,32,0);
T.x = fi([],1,16,0);

x = cast(1:3,'like',T.x);
acc = zeros(1,1,'like',T.acc);

% Assign in to acc without changing its type
for n = 1:length(x)
    acc(:) = acc + x(n) % acc(1) = acc + x(n); % Misma accion
end

%% accumpos and accumneg
% Another way you can control bit growth is by using the accumpos and accumneg 
% functions to perform addition and subtraction operations. 

%% Overflows
% Overflows can occur when the result of an operation exceeds the maximum or 
% minimum representable value. The fimath object has an OverflowAction property which offers 
% two ways of dealing with overflows: saturation and wrap.
